          bound by confidentiality obligations. We may share or otherwise use

          service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they
          use such information. We do not treat Log Data as Personal

          not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account
          ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure
          or unsolicited email or telephone communication. We advise you not to
          respond to, and to promptly report, any email or telephone
          communication purporting to be from More Seconds in which such
